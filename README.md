Other regions show limited activity, indicating expansion opportunities or underdeveloped markets.

Business Recommendations:
1. Optimize Product Strategy
Increase focus on high-margin categories such as Road Bikes and Mountain Bikes through targeted promotions and premium bundles.
Reassess low-performing accessory categories (e.g., Helmets, Tires) by reviewing pricing, sourcing costs, or marketing visibility.

2. Address Declining Order Volume:
Although revenue is growing, declining order and quantity trends may pose long-term risks.
Introduce volume-based discounts, loyalty programs, or subscription offers to encourage repeat purchases and higher order frequency.

3. Customer Segmentation & Targeting:
Develop premium marketing campaigns for professional customers, who generate the highest profit.
Create affordable or bundled offerings tailored for lower-profit segments (e.g., manual workers) to expand market reach.

4. Geographic Expansion Strategy:
Strengthen presence in high-performing regions with localized campaigns and regional partnerships.
Explore untapped regions using pilot campaigns to test demand and pricing sensitivity.

5. Reduce Dependency on High-Value Orders:
Since recent growth is driven by higher ticket sizes rather than order volume, diversifying revenue streams through accessory upselling and cross-selling can stabilize future performance.

6. Returns & Quality Monitoring:
Maintain the low return rate by continuing quality checks and post-purchase customer engagement.
Use return data to identify product-level issues early and reduce operational losses.
